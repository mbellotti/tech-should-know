# Tech Should Know
##### social science for software people
Computers haven't been purely about computating in a long time. Modern computers shape how we interact with each other and the world around us. They define how we discover information, what we buy, how we think about our lives ... all things that social science has spent decades researching.

There's a lot that social scientists know that software people are forced to learn via trial and error. And yet, how is any practitioner supposed to find nudgets of insight spread out across so many different disciplines?

This is a primer on some of the best and most relevant research for software people. Things that will make you think differently about how you build your systems, how you run them and what they do in the first place.
